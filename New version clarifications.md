#### 2. **Implementation Priority**

> **Q**: Should we start with AI architecture consultation or multi-model DCF system?
> **A**:
> üéØ *Start with the AI architecture consultation.*
> Because:

* It affects how DCF and sector logic is routed
* Determines cost & latency envelope for all LLM-based features
* Helps us validate that a **single-agent system** can handle all reasoning steps (valuation, market, fundamentals, macro, etc.)

Once the AI reasoning shell is defined, we can plug in:

* Rule-based DCF models (for Simple Mode)
* Model chaining logic or JSON I/O for Agentic Mode

#### 3. **Content Focus**

> **Q**: Is the TCS example you showed the exact output format and type we want?
> **A**:
> ‚úÖ *Yes, approximately.*
> Target output style:

* **Crisp but informative** (3‚Äì5 key bullets per section)
* **Clear label** + **fair value range**
* Sector-aware language (e.g., "NIM compression", "R\&D < 5% of revenue")
* Avoids speculation unless grounded in data
* Highlights data gaps transparently

We'll evolve exact copy tone during testing ‚Äî current examples are close to desired fidelity.

#### 4. **Technical Integration**

> **Q**: How tightly should AI insights integrate with DCF engine?
> **A**:
> ‚öôÔ∏è *Loose coupling for now, but real-time ready.*

We want:

* Real-time updates **if** data available and API latency is low
* But for MVP, we're okay with **on-demand inference or periodic refresh** (e.g., every 12 hours or on page load)
* DCF engine will expose summary + range as a **structured input** to the Agent

The Agent will **not re-run the DCF** ‚Äî just consume the result + interpret it in context (e.g., "DCF shows 14% upside from CMP").

Let me know if you'd like me to simulate:

* Agentic Mode for a few companies
* Or, cost/timing estimates for integrating the LLM + rules + UI

Ready when you are.

## 📝 **Detailed Prompt Engineering Examples**

### **Phase 1: Architecture & Setup Prompts**

#### **Initial System Design Prompt**
```
I'm building a financial analysis platform for Indian stock markets. Users should be able to:
1. Enter a ticker symbol (e.g., RELIANCE.NS)
2. Get AI-powered qualitative analysis (SWOT, news sentiment)
3. Build interactive DCF models with real-time calculations
4. See sensitivity analysis for key assumptions

Tech requirements:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript for type safety
- Backend: Python (need async for AI calls)
- AI: Need 200K+ context for financial documents
- Data: Free APIs for Indian market data

Help me choose the right tech stack and explain the architecture decisions.
```

#### **Claude Code's Response Pattern**
Claude Code provided:
- **Decision Matrix**: Comparing FastAPI vs Django vs Flask
- **Code Examples**: Actual FastAPI setup with async patterns
- **Architecture Diagrams**: ASCII representations of system flow
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Performance vs complexity for each choice

#### **Follow-up Architecture Refinement**
```
The FastAPI suggestion makes sense. Now help me design the API structure:
- Company analysis endpoint
- DCF calculation endpoint  
- AI analysis endpoint with multi-agent workflow

Also, how should I handle state management in React for:
- DCF assumptions that update in real-time
- Company data that persists across components
- AI analysis results that might take 30+ seconds

Show me the specific code patterns and folder structure.
```

### **Phase 2: Implementation Prompts**

#### **Complex DCF Calculation Logic**
```
I need to implement a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model in Python. Here are the requirements:

Input: Financial data (revenue, EBITDA, debt, cash, shares) + assumptions
Output: Intrinsic value per share with 5-year projections

DCF Formula:
1. Project 5 years of Free Cash Flow = NOPAT + Depreciation - CapEx - Working Capital Change
2. Calculate Terminal Value using Gordon Growth Model  
3. Discount everything to Present Value using WACC
4. Enterprise Value = Sum of PV Cash Flows + PV Terminal Value
5. Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
6. Intrinsic Value = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding

Help me implement this with proper error handling and validation.
```

#### **Real-time React State Management**
```
I have a DCF component that needs to:
1. Fetch default assumptions for a ticker
2. Allow users to adjust assumptions in real-time
3. Recalculate DCF instantly when assumptions change
4. Show loading states and handle errors gracefully

Current issues:
- DCF not updating when I switch tickers (state persistence problem)
- Price showing differently in header vs DCF component  
- Validation errors for banking companies (EBITDA margins >100%)

Help me debug and fix these state management issues.
```

### **Phase 3: Debugging & Production Prompts**

#### **Critical Bug Investigation**
```
I'm getting "Failed to calculate DCF valuation" for HDFC Bank but it works for other companies. 

Here's the error flow:
1. User enters "HDFCBANK" 
2. Backend fetches financial data successfully
3. DCF calculation fails with validation error: "EBITDA margin should be between -20% and 80%"
4. HDFC shows 113% EBITDA margin

The financial data shows:
- Revenue: ₹2.37 trillion
- EBITDA: ₹2.67 trillion  
- This gives 113% margin which breaks validation

Why would a bank have >100% EBITDA margin? How should I handle this?
```

#### **Multi-Agent AI Workflow Design**
```
I want to implement a 4-agent AI workflow for stock analysis:

Agent 1 (Generator): Research company, create initial analysis
Agent 2 (Checker): Fact-check and validate Agent 1's work  
Agent 3 (Bull): Optimistic scenarios and growth opportunities
Agent 4 (Bear): Risk assessment and pessimistic scenarios

Requirements:
- Each agent should build on previous agent's work
- Need source attribution for every claim
- Handle failures gracefully (if Agent 2 fails, continue with Agent 1's work)
- Show real-time progress to user
- Combine all perspectives into final recommendation

Help me design the orchestration logic and error handling.
```

## 🔧 **Specific Claude Code Workflows**

### **Workflow 1: Feature Development Cycle**

#### **Step 1: Planning Prompt**
```
I want to add sensitivity analysis to my DCF model. Users should see how intrinsic value changes when they adjust WACC and terminal growth rate.

Requirements:
- 5x5 matrix showing different scenarios
- Color coding (green for higher values, red for lower)
- Interactive - clicking a cell updates the main DCF calculation
- Should render as a clean table component

Help me plan the implementation approach and identify potential issues.
```

#### **Step 2: Implementation Request**
```
Based on our planning discussion, implement the SensitivityAnalysis React component. 

It should:
- Accept base DCF valuation and assumptions as props
- Generate 5x5 matrix varying WACC (±1%) and terminal growth (±1%)
- Use Tailwind for styling with color-coded cells
- Handle loading states while calculations run
- Be responsive for mobile devices

Show me the complete component with TypeScript types.
```

#### **Step 3: Debugging & Refinement**
```
The sensitivity analysis component works but has performance issues:
- Calculating 25 DCF scenarios takes 15+ seconds
- UI freezes during calculation
- Users think the app crashed

Ideas:
1. Debounce the calculations
2. Show progress indicator
3. Calculate on backend vs frontend
4. Cache results

Which approach is best? Show me the implementation.
```

### **Workflow 2: Bug Investigation Process**

#### **Step 1: Bug Report**
```
Users report that switching between tickers doesn't update the DCF model properly. 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Enter "RELIANCE" - DCF shows ₹1,420 intrinsic value
2. Enter "TCS" - DCF still shows ₹1,420 (should be different)
3. Refresh page - TCS now shows correct value

It seems like React state is persisting across ticker changes. Help me debug this step by step.
```

#### **Step 2: Root Cause Analysis**
```
After your initial debugging suggestions, I found the issue is in DCFCard component. Here's the relevant code:

[Paste actual component code]

The problem seems to be that useEffect dependencies aren't properly set up for ticker changes. The component isn't resetting state when ticker prop changes.

Walk me through the fix and explain why this pattern causes issues.
```

#### **Step 3: Solution Implementation**
```
Implement the state reset pattern you suggested. I need:
- Complete state cleanup when ticker changes
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect  
- Loading state management during transitions
- Error state cleanup

Show me the refactored component with comments explaining the fix.
```

## 🎨 **Prompt Engineering Strategies That Worked**

### **1. Context-Rich Prompts**
**Instead of**: "Help me fix this bug"
**I used**: 
```
I'm building a financial DCF model in React. Users can adjust assumptions and see real-time calculations. 

Current problem: When switching from RELIANCE to TCS, the DCF still shows RELIANCE data.

Here's my component structure: [code]
Here's the error flow: [steps]
Here's what I've tried: [attempts]

Help me debug systematically.
```

**Why this worked**: Provides complete context, shows I've done initial investigation, gives Claude Code enough information to provide targeted help.

### **2. Iterative Refinement**
**Pattern I followed**:
1. **First prompt**: High-level problem and requirements
2. **Second prompt**: Specific implementation request  
3. **Third prompt**: Edge cases and optimizations
4. **Fourth prompt**: Production considerations

**Example Evolution**:
```
Prompt 1: "Help me design a DCF calculation API"
Prompt 2: "Implement the DCF service with proper error handling"  
Prompt 3: "Handle edge cases for banking companies"
Prompt 4: "Add logging and monitoring for production"
```

### **3. Code Review Requests**
```
I've implemented the multi-agent AI workflow. Before deploying to production, please review my code for:

1. Error handling - are there scenarios I missed?
2. Performance - any obvious bottlenecks?

# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Principles for EquityScope

## What is Test-Driven Development?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written **before** the actual code implementation. It follows a simple three-step cycle:

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that defines the desired functionality
2. **GREEN**: Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve the code while keeping all tests passing

## Why We Use TDD in EquityScope

### 1. **Clear Requirements Definition**
- Tests serve as executable specifications
- Forces us to think about API design before implementation
- Prevents feature creep and over-engineering

### 2. **High Code Quality & Coverage**
- Ensures every line of code has a purpose (tested functionality)
- Catches regressions early in development
- Provides confidence when refactoring

### 3. **Better Architecture**
- Writing tests first forces better separation of concerns
- Leads to more modular, testable code
- Prevents tightly coupled dependencies

### 4. **Cost Optimization Validation**
- Critical for our AI service optimization (reducing from 24K to 10K tokens)
- Tests validate that cost reduction doesn't break functionality
- Ensures performance targets are met

## TDD Implementation in EquityScope

### Current TDD Applications

#### 1. **Optimized AI Service** (`test_optimized_ai_service.py`)
```python
# RED: Write failing test for Analysis Engine structure
def test_analysis_engine_agent_structure(self):
    # Define expected output structure
    assert 'company_overview' in result
    assert 'dcf_assumptions' in result
    
# GREEN: Implement minimal Analysis Engine to pass test
async def analysis_engine_agent(self, company_data, news_articles):
    # Return required structure
    
# REFACTOR: Optimize for token usage while keeping tests green
```

#### 2. **Cost Reduction Validation**
```python
def test_cost_calculation_validation(self):
    # Test validates 40%+ cost reduction target
    cost_reduction = (original_tokens - optimized_tokens) / original_tokens
    assert cost_reduction > 0.4
```

#### 3. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
```python
def test_empty_news_handling(self):
    # Test behavior when no news articles available
    
def test_json_parsing_error_handling(self):
    # Test malformed AI responses
```

### TDD Workflow for New Features

1. **Write Test First**
   ```python
   def test_new_feature_functionality(self):
       # Define expected behavior
       result = service.new_feature(input_data)
       assert result.meets_requirements()
   ```

2. **Run Test (Should Fail)**
   ```bash
   pytest test_new_feature.py::test_new_feature_functionality
   # Should fail - feature doesn't exist yet
   ```

3. **Implement Minimal Code**
   ```python
   def new_feature(self, input_data):
       # Minimal implementation to pass test
       return RequiredResult()
   ```

4. **Run Test (Should Pass)**
   ```bash
   pytest test_new_feature.py::test_new_feature_functionality
   # Should pass with minimal implementation
   ```

5. **Refactor & Optimize**
   ```python
   def new_feature(self, input_data):
       # Optimize implementation while keeping test green
       return OptimizedResult()
   ```

## TDD Best Practices for EquityScope

### 1. **Test Structure**
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use fixtures for common test data

### 2. **Test Coverage Targets**
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage (AI agents, DCF calculations)
- **Business logic**: 90%+ coverage
- **UI components**: 80%+ coverage
- **Utilities**: 70%+ coverage

### 3. **Test Categories**

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1ms per test)

#### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real services where feasible
- Medium execution time (< 100ms per test)

#### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Use production-like environment
- Slower execution (< 5s per test)

### 4. **Financial AI Testing Specifics**

#### Mocking AI Responses
```python
@patch.object(ai_service, 'generate_completion')
def test_ai_agent_output(self, mock_completion):
    mock_completion.return_value = json.dumps(expected_response)
    result = await ai_service.analysis_engine_agent(data, news)
    assert result['company_overview']['investment_thesis'] is not None
```

#### Testing Token Optimization
```python
def test_token_usage_optimization(self):
    # Validate target token counts
    assert analysis_engine_tokens <= 8000
    assert dcf_validator_tokens <= 2000
    assert total_tokens <= 10000  # 50% reduction target
```

#### Testing Financial Calculations
```python
def test_dcf_calculation_accuracy(self):
    # Use known inputs with expected outputs
    assumptions = DCFAssumptions(revenue_growth=10.0, ...)
    result = dcf_service.calculate_valuation(assumptions)
    assert abs(result.intrinsic_value - expected_value) < 0.01
```

## Running Tests

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest backend/tests/test_optimized_ai_service.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=backend/app/services/

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_ai_agent"
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# In CI pipeline
pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=xml --junitxml=test-results.xml
```

## TDD Benefits Realized in EquityScope

### 1. **Cost Optimization Confidence**
- Tests validate 50% token reduction without functionality loss
- Regression prevention during optimization
- Performance benchmarking built-in

### 2. **Financial Accuracy Assurance**
- DCF calculations tested with known scenarios
- Edge cases handled (banking companies, missing data)
- Validation logic thoroughly tested

### 3. **Rapid Development Cycle**
- Clear requirements from failing tests
- Confident refactoring with test coverage
- Early bug detection

### 4. **Documentation Through Tests**
- Tests serve as living documentation
- Examples of expected inputs/outputs
- Clear behavior specifications

## Future TDD Applications

### 1. **Multi-Model DCF System**
- Test DDM for banking companies
- Test Asset-based models for REITs
- Test model selection logic

### 2. **Mobile UX Components**
- Test touch-friendly controls
- Test responsive layouts
- Test progressive disclosure

### 3. **User Education Features**
- Test onboarding flow
- Test demo mode functionality
- Test "What This Means" sections

## Conclusion

TDD is essential for EquityScope's success because:

1. **Financial accuracy is critical** - tests prevent calculation errors
2. **Cost optimization is mandatory** - tests validate token reduction targets
3. **User experience matters** - tests ensure features work as expected
4. **Rapid iteration required** - tests enable confident changes

By following TDD principles, we ensure EquityScope delivers reliable, cost-effective financial analysis while maintaining high code quality and user satisfaction.

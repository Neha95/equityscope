# 🚀 EquityScope v2-Optimized - Ready for Manual Testing!

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Development Environment
```bash
cd /Users/mmazumdar/Desktop/neha-codes/qualitative-edge/v2-optimized
./start_development.sh
```

### 2. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

### 3. Stop the Servers
```bash
./stop_development.sh
```

### 4. Health Check
```bash
./health_check.sh
```

## 🎯 What's Ready for Testing

### ✅ Core Features
1. **Demo Mode**: Pre-built analyses for TCS, Reliance, HDFC Bank
2. **10-Year DCF Analysis**: Multi-stage projections with GDP blending
3. **AI Investment Committee**: Bull, Bear, Neutral perspectives
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Educational content for all levels
5. **Mobile-Optimized UI**: Touch-friendly controls and responsive design
6. **User Authentication**: Registration, login, rate limiting (backend ready)
7. **Data Validation**: Smart warnings for unrealistic assumptions

### 📊 Test Scenarios

#### Demo Mode Testing
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Try Demo" or search for "TCS"
3. Select TCS.NS from dropdown
4. Review the comprehensive analysis
5. Try different companies: Reliance, HDFC Bank

#### DCF Analysis Testing
1. Search for any Indian stock ticker (e.g., "INFY", "WIPRO")
2. Adjust assumptions using +/- buttons (mobile-friendly)
3. See real-time valuation updates
4. Review "What This Means" explanations

#### Mobile Testing
1. Open on mobile device or use browser dev tools
2. Test touch controls for assumption adjustments
3. Long-press tooltips for educational content
4. Verify responsive layout

#### Error Handling Testing
1. Try invalid ticker symbols
2. Test with unrealistic assumptions (>30% growth)
3. Verify error boundaries and recovery actions

## 📁 Data Storage

All data is stored in the file system:
- **User Data**: `backend/data/users/users.json`
- **Sessions**: `backend/data/users/sessions.json`
- **API Keys**: `backend/data/users/api_keys.json`
- **Cache**: `backend/cache/`
- **Logs**: `backend/logs/`

## 🔧 Key Testing Areas

### 1. User Experience
- [ ] Onboarding flow works smoothly
- [ ] Search suggestions are helpful
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Mobile experience is touch-optimized

### 2. DCF Analysis Quality
- [ ] Valuations seem reasonable for known companies
- [ ] Assumptions validation catches unrealistic inputs
- [ ] "What This Means" sections are educational
- [ ] Different user levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced) work

### 3. Performance
- [ ] Initial load time is acceptable
- [ ] Analysis results appear within 30 seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks or excessive resource usage
- [ ] Caching improves repeat analysis speed

### 4. Reliability
- [ ] Error boundaries prevent crashes
- [ ] API endpoints handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Data persistence works correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow (when frontend connected)

## 🐛 Known Issues/Limitations

1. **Authentication UI**: Backend is ready, frontend integration in progress
2. **External APIs**: Demo mode uses static data, live analysis needs API keys
3. **Data Persistence**: Currently file-based, can migrate to PostgreSQL later
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented but not strictly enforced in development

## 📈 Success Metrics

The system is considered ready for production when:
- [ ] All demo analyses load within 5 seconds
- [ ] Mobile experience is smooth and intuitive
- [ ] Error handling prevents system crashes
- [ ] Educational content helps users understand DCF concepts
- [ ] Authentication and user management work end-to-end

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Server Status
```bash
./health_check.sh
```

### View Logs
```bash
# Backend logs
tail -f backend/logs/app.log

# Frontend logs  
# Check browser console for errors
```

### Common Issues
- **Port 8000 in use**: Stop other Python servers or change port in `.env`
- **Port 3000 in use**: React will automatically use next available port
- **Permission errors**: Ensure scripts are executable with `chmod +x`

# Qualitative Edge - Development Session Notes
*Last Updated: July 25, 2025*

## 🎯 Current Status
- **Platform**: Working financial analysis tool with DCF modeling + AI agents
- **Mode**: Personal project, no real users yet (honest documentation approach)
- **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript frontend, FastAPI + Python backend, Claude AI

## 🚨 Recent Critical Fixes (This Session)
1. **Stock Autocomplete**: "SBI" now finds "SBIN.NS" - major UX improvement
2. **DCF Bug**: Fixed ITC units mismatch (₹12.48 vs ₹1515) with smart detection
3. **Real-time Updates**: DCF assumptions now update intrinsic value instantly
4. **Tooltips**: All metrics have helpful explanations on hover
5. **Simple UI**: Replaced complex sliders with +/- buttons

## 🔄 Immediate Next Priorities
1. **Test current features** thoroughly 
2. **Perplexity integration** for better news/sentiment
3. **Kite API** for real-time data (vs delayed Yahoo)
4. **AI Investment Committee redesign** - unified Bull/Bear commentator
5. **Industry-specific DCF** context (banking vs IT vs pharma)

## 🐛 Known Issues to Address
- **AI Analysis vs DCF mismatch**: Bull/Bear mention different prices than DCF calculation
- **Investment Committee layout**: Need clearer stock recommendation at top
